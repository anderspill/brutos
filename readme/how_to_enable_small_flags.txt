How to enable small flags

DVX Logos displays small FA logos on player profile screens and in many other
places. If you would rather have the small logos be replaced by small flags,
you can do it by following these steps:

1. Go to "dvx-logos\associations\primary\small"
2. Locate small_flags.zip
3. Extract the zip archive to "dvx-logos\associations\primary\small"
4. Overwrite the config.xml that is located there
5. Reload your FM skin with skin caching disabled
6. The small flags should now be displayed instead of the small FA logos
