How to replace tournament specific logos

Some primary competition logos within the pack are tournament specific. Examples
of these would be World Cup and Olympic Games logos that will become "outdated"
once the tournaments have been played. Tournament specific logos can be replaced
with more general alternative logos by following the steps described below.


How to replace tournament logos:

1. Go to "dvx-logos\competitions\alternative" folder
2. Choose which logo you prefer and remember its name
3. Locate the config.xml that is in the same folder
4. Open the config with a text editor
5. Remove letters "X" from near the beginning of the rows that handle your logo of choice
6. Save the config and reload your FM skin with skin caching disabled
7. The alternative logo should now be displyed instead of the primary logo


Example:
Do this to enable alternative FIFA World Cup logo:

Locate rows that handle the FIFA World Cup inside the config.xml file

		<!-- FIFA World Cup -->
		<Xrecord from="fifa_competitions" to="graphics/pictures/comp/1301385/logo"/>
		<Xrecord from="small/fifa_competitions" to="graphics/pictures/comp/1301385/icon"/>

Remove letters "X" from near the beginning of the rows. "Xrecord" becomes "record".

		<!-- FIFA World Cup -->
		<record from="fifa_competitions" to="graphics/pictures/comp/1301385/logo"/>
		<record from="small/fifa_competitions" to="graphics/pictures/comp/1301385/icon"/>

Save the config file and reload your Football Manager skin. The alternative World Cup
logo should now be shown in place of the primary World Cup logo.
