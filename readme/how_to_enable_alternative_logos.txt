How to use alternative logos

1. Go to "alternative" folder
2. Choose which logo you prefer and remember its name
3. Locate the config.xml that is in the same "alternative" folder
4. Open the config with a text editor
5. Remove letters "X" from near the beginning of the rows that handle your logo of choice
6. Save the config and reload your FM skin with skin caching disabled
7. The alternative logo should now be displyed instead of the primary logo


Example:
Do this to enable alternative Lecce logo "uefa_ita_lecce_alt-1":

Locate rows with the name of the logo inside the config.xml file

		<!-- Lecce -->
		<Xrecord from="uefa_ita_lecce_alt-1" to="graphics/pictures/club/1141/logo"/> 
		<Xrecord from="small/uefa_ita_lecce_alt-1" to="graphics/pictures/club/1141/icon"/> 

Remove letters "X" from near the beginning of the rows. "Xrecord" becomes "record".

		<!-- Lecce -->
		<record from="uefa_ita_lecce_alt-1" to="graphics/pictures/club/1141/logo"/> 
		<record from="small/uefa_ita_lecce_alt-1" to="graphics/pictures/club/1141/icon"/> 

Save the config file and reload your Football Manager skin. The alternative Lecce
logo should now be shown in place of the primary Lecce logo.
